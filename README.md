# CS351-and-CS452
CS351 is Algorithms, and CS452 is Parallel Algorithms (MPI environment). Both classes use C++ for coding

CS351:
  All projects in CS351 (Algorithms) solved the 0-1 Knapsack Problem, just with different algorithmic techniques.

- Project 1 (Project1): Greedy Algorithm
- Project 2 (CS351Project2): Dynamic Programming
- Project 3 (0-1 Knapsack with backtracking): Backtracking

CS452:
  Parallel Algorithms introduced algorithms to a Parallel environment. I've learned how to approach some difficult CS problems, and how to manipulate expressions to be able to pass off an algorithm with (for example) O(n) work time, etc. 

- Project 1 (452Proj1): Familiarizing with MPI
- Project 2 (mergesort.cpp): Sequential Mergesort
- Project 3 (pm.cpp): Parallel Merge Problem
- Project 4: 2-3 Trees (**IN PROGRESS)
